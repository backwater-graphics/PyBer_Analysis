# PyBer RideShare Analysis
## Overview
The CEO of Pyber V. Isualize wants to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for PyBer. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to do an analysis of the PyBer ride share data to gain a better understanding of how their ridership and their fare metrics by the city types are doing. This project will include creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, along with using Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type to help improve their ridership.

## Results
-After reviewing the PyBer ride share analysis we can see the differences in the ride-sharing data among the three city types: Urban, Suburban, Rural in the chart below.

#### Average fare per ride: 
When we look at the average fares per ride amongst the three city types, we noticed that the Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride at $34.62 and Urban cities have the lowest average fare per rider at $24.53. Suburban is in the middle of the average fares sitting at $30.97 per ride.

#### Average fare per driver: 
When we look at the average fares per driver amongst the three city types, we noticed that the Rural cities have the highest average fare per driver at $55.49 and Urban cities have the lowest average fare per driver at $16.57. Suburban is in the middle of the average fares sitting at $39.50 per ride.

#### Total Rides:

When we look at the total rides amongst the three city types was see that the Urban cities have the greatest demand for riders, with suburban cities next, and then with the lowest demand for riders would be the rural cities.

#### Total Drivers:

When I did the analysis on the number of total drivers amongst the three city types, we noticed that the urban cities had about 5x times more drivers than suburban cities.  Like Urban cities, the Suburban cities had a little over 6x more drivers than Rural cities. The Rural cities had the lowest number of drivers.

#### Total Fares:

When we look at the pie chart for the total fares amongst the three city types, we noticed that between the three city types Urban total fares make up about 62%, whereas Suburban total fares make up about 30% and Rural total fares comes in at about 6%.

##  Summary
After reviewing the PyBer ride share analysis we see that the urban cities have the highest demand for riders while the rural cities have the lowest demand for riders. We also see that urban cities have about 5 times more drivers than their counter parts in Suburban cities based on the various metrics we used for the PyBer ride-sharing data, based on this analysis here are the recommendations I have that will address the various disparities among the city types:

#### 1st Business recommendation:
The first recommendation that I would recommend for PyBer would be to look at the Rural cities which account for the lowest number of rides and the smallest number of fares among all of the city types, however the average fare per ride is the highest amongst all the city types. For this reason, I would recommend to increase the ridership, along with adding more drivers in the Rural area by investing in Marketing to promote PyBer ride-sharing company.

#### 2nd Business recommendation
The second recommendation that I would recommend for PyBer would be to increase the fares in the Urban cities fares as it appears that drivers in rural cities are earning more than drivers in urban cities. This could discourage potential drivers from working with PyBer rideshare company in Urban cities given the low average fare per driver.

#### 3rd Business recommendation
The third and final recommendation that I would recommend for PyBer rideshare company would be to look at increasing the drivers in the Suburban and Rural cities. When we look at these two cities, we noticed that they comprise roughly 35% of all rides and fares and only 22% of the total driver population which means they have an opportunity to boost driver counts in these regions to enhance market shares.
